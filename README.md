To access the application's features, users must log in using their individual authentication credentials. Logging in is essential to ensure the security and privacy of users and to control access to various application functions. The login interface allows users to enter their username and password. Upon successful authentication, users gain access to the main application interface.

II. Application Dashboard

Upon logging in, users are directed to the application dashboard, where all reservations are displayed along with controls for managing them. The dashboard provides an overview of existing reservations, including details such as customer name, reservation dates, and status. Additionally, users can utilize various controls and filters to streamline reservation management tasks. These controls may include options for sorting reservations, applying filters based on specific criteria, and performing bulk actions such as editing or deleting multiple reservations simultaneously. The application dashboard serves as a centralized hub for efficiently managing reservations, allowing users to navigate and interact with reservation data seamlessly.

III. Managing Reservations

The application allows users to perform basic operations related to reservation management. These operations include adding, editing, and deleting reservations along with their detailed data. Below are the main functions related to reservation management:

Adding Reservations: Users can add new reservations by providing necessary information such as customer personal data, preferred dates, and other reservation details.
Editing Reservations: There is an option to modify existing reservations. Users can update reservation data, such as changing dates, adding/removing services, or updating customer personal information.
Deleting Reservations: Users have the ability to remove unnecessary reservations from the system. The deletion operation allows for the removal of individual reservations from the database.
The application interface provides intuitive tools for managing reservations, allowing users to conveniently utilize the add, edit, and delete reservation functions. Each operation is appropriately secured to ensure data integrity and protect user privacy.

IV. Data Validation

To ensure the accuracy and integrity of data entered into the system, the application implements robust data validation mechanisms. These mechanisms validate user input to prevent erroneous or malicious data from being processed. Data validation includes:

Client-Side Validation: Implemented using JavaScript or other client-side scripting languages, client-side validation provides immediate feedback to users when they enter data into form fields. This helps in catching errors early and improving user experience.
Server-Side Validation: Server-side validation is performed on the server after the form is submitted. It serves as a secondary line of defense to ensure that only valid data is accepted by the application. Server-side validation checks include verifying data format, range validation, and checking for any inconsistencies or anomalies.
By employing both client-side and server-side validation techniques, the application ensures that only accurate and appropriate data is accepted, minimizing the risk of data corruption or security vulnerabilities.

V. Data Filtering

The application includes data filtering capabilities to enable users to efficiently search and retrieve relevant information. Users can apply filters based on various criteria such as date, customer name, or reservation status. This feature enhances user experience by allowing them to quickly locate specific reservations or narrow down search results according to their preferences. Data filtering ensures that users can access the information they need promptly, contributing to improved productivity and usability of the application.

VI. Technologies used
The application is built using ASP.NET for the backend development, providing a robust and scalable framework for web application development. For data storage, the application utilizes SQLite, a lightweight and efficient relational database management system (RDBMS). These technologies are chosen for their reliability, performance, and compatibility with the requirements of the reservation management application
